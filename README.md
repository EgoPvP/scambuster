# ScamBusters
Discord Bot Fighting Nitro, Steam &amp; other Scammers!

---

Using a list of over 10.000 Blacklisted URL's this Bot scanns all messages send for any of the recognized known Scammer urls.

Anything from “Free nitro” to “steam acoount” Scams are covered and many more!

Global-Bans across all Servers where the Bot is used make it possible to fight Scammers across Discord and help everyone Stay safe!

## How does this work:
Upon detecting a blocked url, this bot Bans the member, deleted the last message & adds them into a “bad-user” list. If the User is on another Server using the Bot and they have it enabled, the bot will auto-ban this scamming / compromised user in the other server too, to prevent any more damage.
